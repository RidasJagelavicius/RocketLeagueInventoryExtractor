# Week 1:
1. Log/Implemented:
  1. Installed openCV and figured out most of the methodology behind my approach
  1. Text-Detection using EAST
1. Conflicts:
  1. Program won't compile when opencv2/dnn header is included. I've tried posting on the OpenCV forums, googling for two hours, piazza, and office hours. Will see if moderator can help tomorrow
  1. Visual Studio won't show any non-cpp files in solution
1. What's Next:
  1. Figure out how to compile code
  1. Run Text-Recognition using Tesseract to extract text from bounded regions
  1. Create a JSON Database file using Python text-scraped from rl.insider.gg
1. References
  1. Where the implementation of the text-detection came from: https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/blob/master/TextDetectionEAST/textDetection.cpp
  1. Understanding of how the preprocessing works in blobFromImage: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/11/06/deep-learning-opencvs-blobfromimage-works/
